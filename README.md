# CSE-231
Michigan State Python Programming

There's not really much to see here from the standpoint of new and exciting code.
It is mainly a bunch of exercises from my programming class that's structured by Exercises, Homework, Labs, and Projects.
From there they are broken down by [item][number]. its pretty hierarchical.

The projects cover topics ranging from hello world to more advanced topics like multi class/function programs with various data structures.

Hope you find this helpful in one form or another.

Thanks for looking!
