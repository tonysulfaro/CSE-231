# CSE-231
Michigan State Python Programming

There's not really much to see here from the standpoint of new and exciting code.
It is mainly a bunch of exercises from my programming class so everything from hello world to more advanced topics.

Hope you find this helpful in one form or another

Thanks for looking!
